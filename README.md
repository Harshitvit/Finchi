# Finchi - AI Assistant Website

**Finchi** is a voice-activated AI assistant, similar to Google Assistant or Alexa, built as a web-based project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This AI assistant allows users to interact through voice commands, making tasks like searching the web or getting basic responses convenient and efficient.

## Features:
- **Voice Activation**: Finchi can listen to user commands and respond accordingly using speech recognition and synthesis.
- **Web-Based Interface**: A simple, user-friendly interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Finchi provides instant responses to user commands using JavaScript-based voice APIs.

## How It Works:
1. The assistant listens to the userâ€™s voice commands.
2. It processes the command and provides a response either by speaking out the result or performing a task like web search.
3. The speech synthesis feature enables the assistant to respond in real-time.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the website.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the logic, including voice command processing and response generation.
- **Speech Recognition API**: To convert spoken words into text commands.
- **Speech Synthesis API**: To provide voice feedback to the user.

## Usage:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the `index.html` file in a browser to use the assistant.

## Future Improvements:
- Integrating React to make the website more dynamic and scalable.
- Adding more complex features like connecting to APIs for tasks such as checking the weather, setting reminders, and more.
